This repository contains a bash script demonstrating a subtle error in handling non-numeric input when calculating the sum of numbers from a file.  The script uses a `while` loop to read numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'.  However, if this file contains any non-numeric data, the script fails silently without error messages, leading to an incorrect sum.  The solution demonstrates how to robustly handle potential errors using error checking and input validation techniques.
